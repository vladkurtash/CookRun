Basic use:
1. Create a Plane - GameObject -> 3D Object -> Plane
2. Create a new material, drag the appropriate Vertical Fog.shader on top of the material and then apply the material to the plane/object

If shader is fully transparent and you're developing for mobile, attach the script from "Fix" folder to your Main Camera!

Unzip the HDRP shader zip only if you're using HDRP. Otherwise it will give you errors.
